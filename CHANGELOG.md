---

## 0.9.21

**Auto-accept Chrome 146 remote debugging consent dialog**

### Changes
- Chrome 146 consent port shows "Allow remote debugging?" dialog on every connection — user had to manually click Allow each time
- Now auto-clicks the Allow button via macOS Accessibility API (AXSheet + AXButton description="Allow") in parallel with the WebSocket connection
- Users no longer need to manually confirm remote debugging — connect_cdp works seamlessly

---

## 0.9.20

**Respect launch_chrome:false — skip session-copy when user Chrome has no debug port**

### Changes
- When launch_chrome:false, Chrome is running but has no debug port: now fails with a clear error instead of launching a session-copy Chrome
- Previously Steps 2&3 (enable via chrome://inspect and restart with debug port) ran even with launch_chrome:false, overriding user intent
- Now Steps 2&3 only run when launch_chrome:true; false means "use existing debug port only"

---

## 0.9.10

**UX fixes: fill tool, press_key iOS fallback, go_back count, coordinate hint**

### Bug Fixes
- **`fill` tool registered**: `fill` was documented but threw `Unknown tool: fill`. Now maps to `enter_text` (clear + set value). Closes user-reported issue.
- **`press_key` on iOS/Android**: Added NativeDriver fallback so `press_key` works in Flutter VM Service mode on simulators/emulators (previously returned unsupported error). Enter key now triggers iOS search without needing CDP mode.
- **`enter_text` without key**: When called without `key`/`ref`, returns an actionable `hint` field pointing to `inspect_interactive()` instead of the confusing `No TextField matching key 'null' found` error.
- **`go_back` with `count`**: Accepts a `count` parameter to pop multiple routes in one call with 300 ms pauses between steps — replaces repeated `go_back()` chains.
- **`native_screenshot` coordinate hint**: Response now includes `scale_factor` and a `coordinate_hint` field that explains the physical→logical pixel conversion, eliminating manual coordinate guessing.

---

## 0.9.9

**C++ desktop automation SDK**

### New SDK
- **C++ Bridge SDK** (`sdks/cpp/`): Cross-platform native C++ automation bridge. Embeds a zero-dependency WebSocket server (RFC 6455) + JSON-RPC 2.0 dispatcher in your C++ app so AI agents can control it via the flutter-skill protocol. Closes #22.
  - **macOS**: CGEvent for input synthesis, `screencapture` for screenshots, AXUIElement for accessibility inspection
  - **Windows**: `SendInput` + GDI+ (screenshots) + `GetForegroundWindow`
  - **Linux**: XTest extension + XGetImage/libpng + EWMH
  - No external dependencies — SHA-1, base64, and WebSocket framing are bundled
  - Full CMake build system (`CMakeLists.txt`) for all three platforms
- **Tests**: 30 unit tests (JSON-RPC, SHA-1/base64/WebSocket RFC vectors, bridge protocol with mock backend) + 27 real integration tests verified live on macOS (1630 KB PNG screenshot, tap, scroll, all key names, enter_text, inspect, window title)

---

## 0.9.8

**Multi-flavor app detection, fresh-install UX, Docker/Snap build fixes, CI smoke tests**

### Bug Fixes
- **Multi-flavor app detection** (#24): `scan_and_connect` now accepts `flavor` and `device_id` parameters. When multiple flavors run simultaneously, flutter-skill picks the correct instance instead of connecting randomly.
- **Fresh-install plugins warning** (#23): Removed the `Plugins directory not found` warning on clean installs — silently skipped instead.
- **Docker build**: Dockerfile now uses `ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:stable` so `flutter pub get` resolves Flutter SDK dependencies correctly.
- **Snap build**: Added `git config --global --add safe.directory /opt/flutter` to resolve `detected dubious ownership` error in snapcraft builds.

### CI / Testing
- Smoke test job added to CI: verifies fresh `flutter pub global activate` install works end-to-end.
- Post-release smoke test in release workflow: installs from pub.dev and npm after publish and confirms server responds.

---

## 0.9.7

**press_key for Flutter VM Service, pytest plugin, HarmonyOS SDK, CI smoke tests**

### Bug Fixes
- **press_key in Flutter mode**: `press_key` now works when connected via VM Service (not just CDP/bridge). Calls the existing `ext.flutter.flutter_skill.pressKey` extension that was already registered in the target app but never wired from the CLI side. Fixes #21.

### New SDKs
- **pytest-flutter-skill** (`sdks/python/`): pytest plugin for AI-driven Flutter/web app automation. Provides a `flutter_skill` fixture that starts the MCP server and wraps all tools as Python methods with native pytest assertions (`assert_visible`, `assert_text`, `assert_not_visible`, `find_element`). Closes #14.
- **HarmonyOS SDK** (`sdks/harmonyos/`): ArkTS bridge SDK (`FlutterSkillAbility.ets`) for HarmonyOS apps. Implements screenshot, tap, enter_text, press_key, scroll, go_back, get_current_route, inspect, get_logs over WebSocket on port 18118. Closes #13.

### CI / Testing
- **Smoke test job** added to CI: simulates a new user installing from local source via `dart pub global activate`, then verifies `--version`, MCP `initialize`, and `tools/list` work correctly.
- **Post-release smoke test** added to release workflow: installs from pub.dev and npm after each release (with retry for CDN propagation) and verifies the published package serves JSON-RPC correctly.

---

## 0.9.6

**Shadow DOM deep pierce for tap/snapshot, serve port reuse fix**

### Changes
- `tap` text search now uses `_dqAll('*')` instead of a hardcoded tag list, so custom elements like Reddit's `faceplate-button` are found by text match
- Snapshot second pass collects `button/[role=button]/[type=submit]` elements nested inside shadow roots
- `serve` binds with `shared: true` (SO_REUSEADDR) to avoid TIME_WAIT "Address already in use" crashes on restart

---

## 0.9.1

**CLI client commands, GitHub Pages docs, comprehensive platform guide**

### New Features
- **CLI client commands for serve API**: `nav`, `snap`, `screenshot`, `tap`, `type`, `key`, `eval`, `title`, `text`, `hover`, `upload`, `tools`, `call`, `wait`
- **GitHub Pages documentation site**: Static docs site at `docs/site/` with auto-deploy workflow

### Documentation
- Comprehensive IDE/platform integration guide with all supported AI platforms
- CLI client reference (`docs/CLI_CLIENT.md`) with scripting examples and CI/CD patterns
- Updated IDE setup guide with OpenClaw serve mode and Continue.dev sections

### Bug Fixes
- **Chrome WebSocket 403 Forbidden**: Fixed Origin header handling
- **Domain-based tab matching**: Never hijack unrelated tabs
- **PUT for /json/new**: Chrome 145+ requires PUT instead of GET

---

## 0.9.0

**iOS native automation + React Native support + bridge reliability**

### New Features
- **6 native P0 tools**: `native_long_press`, `native_gesture`, `native_press_key`, `native_key_combo`, `native_button`, `native_list_simulators`
- **Video recording**: `native_video_start` / `native_video_stop` — H.264 MP4 via simctl recordVideo
- **Frame capture**: `native_capture_frames` — burst JPEG at configurable FPS
- **Hardware buttons**: `apple_pay` and `side` button support via HID injection
- **fs-ios-bridge**: Native ObjC HID injector (74KB) using SimulatorKit private APIs — ~1ms latency vs ~1s for osascript
- **React Native iOS**: Full bridge + native tool support verified (41/42 pass)

### Bug Fixes
- **Bridge mode null safety**: drag coordinate support, edge_swipe defaults, assert_text nullable key
- **execute_batch**: accepts both `actions` and `commands` param names
- **native_gesture/key_combo**: flexible param types (List and String)
- **get_widget_properties**: improved error message for missing key
- **get_text_value**: nullable key support

### Test Results

- **10** platforms supported
- **fs-ios-bridge**: tap, long-press, swipe, key, button, gesture, screenshot, key-combo, text, list

## 0.8.9

**Heavy DOM site stability + CI fixes**

### Bug Fixes
- **get_network_requests**: Limited to 100 entries (configurable via `limit` param) — prevents OOM/hang on heavy DOM sites (YouTube, Amazon, Reddit)
- **dart analyze**: Resolved all 8 warnings (unused vars, unnecessary null assertions)
- **dart format**: Formatted all 41 files

### Performance Verified — Heavy DOM Sites
| Site | Tools | Time | Snapshot |
|------|-------|------|----------|
| YouTube | 15/15 ✅ | 6.9s | 43ms |
| Amazon | 15/15 ✅ | 14.2s | 1ms |
| Reddit | 15/15 ✅ | 17.9s | 6ms |
| HN | 15/15 ✅ | 4.8s | 53ms |
| Wikipedia | 15/15 ✅ | 7.8s | 15ms |

## 0.8.8

**CDP reliability + multi-platform fixes**

### Bug Fixes
- **swipe/drag/gesture**: Single 10s overall timeout instead of per-event (prevents cascading CDP failures)
- **connect_cdp**: URL now optional — port-only connections for Electron, Android, external browsers
- **Region screenshots**: JPEG@80 with 10s timeout + fallback to full screenshot
- **switch_tab/close_tab**: Support `index` param (AI agents pass index, not target_id)
- **diff_baseline_create**: Added `max_pages` param (default 10) to prevent unbounded crawling
- **CDP JSON serialization**: All JS returns use `JSON.stringify()` → `jsonDecode()` for reliable object handling

### Refactoring
- Extracted `_jsResolveElement()` and `_parseJsonEval()` helpers — eliminated hardcoded selector patterns
- Net -75 lines in CDP driver

### Test Results
| Platform | Pass | Fail | Skip |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Web CDP | 140 | 2 | 23 |
| Electron | 139 | 0 | 26 |
| Flutter Web | 139 | 0 | 26 |
| Android | 134 | 5 | 26 |

- **Screenshot after navigation**: Fixed stale screenshot showing old page after `Navigator.push()`. Now captures from the RenderView layer instead of first RepaintBoundary, correctly rendering the current visible page
- **enter_text without key**: Can now enter text into the currently focused TextField without providing a widget key. Tap a field first, then call `enter_text(text: "...")`
- **assert_text on buttons**: `assert_text` now reads child Text widgets from buttons, labels, and other non-TextField elements
- **Session auto-switch**: `connect_app`, `launch_app`, and `scan_and_connect` now always switch the active session to the newly connected app
- **screenshot_region**: Added `save_to_file` support (saves to temp file like regular screenshot)
- **get_errors pagination**: Added `limit` and `offset` parameters to prevent massive responses

---

## 0.6.0

**Enhanced smart discovery with parallel port checking and priority-based selection**

### 🚀 Features
- **Parallel Port Checking**: 6x faster port scanning by checking all ports simultaneously
  - Sequential (old): 6 ports × 500ms = 3000ms
  - Parallel (new): 500ms (returns as soon as first succeeds)
  - Uses `Future.any()` to race all port checks
- **Priority-Based Smart Selection**: Intelligent app ranking for zero manual selection
  - Ranks by: exact directory match → device match → recency (lowest PID)
  - Auto-selects correct app based on current working directory
  - Handles multiple apps in same location with device filtering
- **Process-Based Discovery**: Extract VM Service URI directly from running processes
  - No port scanning needed for most cases
  - Uses `ps aux` and `lsof` for instant discovery

### ⚡ Performance Improvements
- Port scanning: 3000ms → 500ms (6x faster)
- Process discovery: 200ms → 100ms (2x faster)
- Multi-app selection: Manual → Auto (instant)

### 🌍 Internationalization

- 🔧 **Fixed JSON Serialization Error in find_by_type**: Added `safeRound()` helper to handle NaN/Infinity values
  - Previously crashed with "Unsupported object: NaN" or "Unsupported object: Infinity"
  - Now safely converts all coordinate values to finite integers
  - Consistent with `inspect()` implementation

- 📍 **Improved TextField Coordinate Detection**: Added reliability detection for widget coordinates
  - New `coordinatesReliable` flag on all elements
  - Detects when TextFields report false (0,0) coordinates
  - Provides warning message: "Coordinates may be unreliable - use key or text for targeting"
  - Helps AI agents know when to fall back to key/text-based targeting

### 🔧 Improvements
- 📋 **Enhanced MCP Tool Descriptions**: Updated `inspect` and `find_by_type` documentation
  - Documents `coordinatesReliable` flag in output format
  - Warns about TextField coordinate issues
  - Guides AI agents to use keys when coordinates are unreliable

### 💡 Benefits
- ✅ find_by_type no longer crashes on off-screen or animated widgets
- ✅ AI agents can detect unreliable coordinates and adjust targeting strategy
- ✅ Better error messages guide users to use keys instead of coordinates
- ✅ More robust JSON serialization prevents crashes

### 📝 Migration Guide
No breaking changes. New `coordinatesReliable` field is optional to check:

```dart
// Check coordinate reliability before using coordinates
final elements = await inspect();
for (final element in elements) {
  if (element['coordinatesReliable'] == true) {
    // Safe to use bounds/center coordinates
    tap(x: element['center']['x'], y: element['center']['y']);
  } else {
    // Fall back to key/text targeting
    if (element['key'] != null) {
      tap(key: element['key']);
    }
  }
}
```

**Smart Diagnosis Tool**

### New MCP Tools

- `diagnose` - Intelligent log and UI analysis with fix suggestions
  - Analyzes logs for common error patterns (network, layout, null errors)
  - Detects UI issues (empty state, high memory usage)
  - Returns structured diagnosis with issues, suggestions, and next steps
  - Calculates health score (0-100)

### Supported Issue Detection

| Type | Severity | Detection |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Network connection error | critical | Log pattern matching |
| Timeout exception | critical | Log pattern matching |
| Layout overflow | warning | Log pattern matching |
| Null check error | critical | Log pattern matching |
| State error (disposed widget) | warning | Log pattern matching |
| High memory usage | warning | Memory threshold check |
| Empty UI state | warning | UI element inspection |

### Example Usage

```json
// Call diagnose tool
{ "tool": "diagnose", "arguments": { "scope": "all" } }

// Returns
{
  "summary": { "total_issues": 2, "critical": 1, "warning": 1, "health_score": 60 },
  "issues": [ { "id": "E001", "type": "network_connection_error", "severity": "critical" } ],
  "suggestions": [ { "for_issue": "E001", "action": "Check network configuration", "steps": [...] } ],
  "next_steps": [ { "tool": "tap", "params": { "text": "Retry" } } ]
}
```

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {"code": "E201", "message": "Failed to connect after 3 attempts"},
  "suggestions": ["Try scan_and_connect()", "Verify app is running"]
}
```

## 0.2.15

**Critical Bug Fixes & AI Agent Improvements**

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed tap/enter_text/scroll_to returning misleading success** - Now returns `{success: false, error: "Element not found"}` when element not found
- Previously these tools returned success even when the target element didn't exist

### New MCP Tools
- `edge_swipe` - Swipe from screen edge for drawer menus and iOS back gestures
  - Parameters: `edge` (left/right/top/bottom), `direction` (up/down/left/right), `distance`
- `screenshot_region` - Capture a cropped region of the screen

### Enhanced Tools
- `inspect` now returns element coordinates:
  - `position: {x, y}` - top-left corner
  - `size: {width, height}` - element dimensions
  - `center: {x, y}` - center point for coordinate-based tapping
  - `semanticsLabel` - accessibility label when available
- `screenshot` now accepts:
  - `quality` (0.1-1.0) - reduce image size via pixel ratio
  - `max_width` - scale down large screenshots

### Improvements
- Better error messages with element key/text in failure responses
- Tappable elements (InkWell, GestureDetector) now include extracted text
